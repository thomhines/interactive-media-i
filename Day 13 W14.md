*At least one form is required in your Project 2 Site*




### Discuss designs

Break up class into small groups. Let other groups work on their stuff while I talk to each group of 3-4 students in turn. That way each group gets longer feedback and students get more time to work.

### Work session





HW
---------------------------------------


1. **Refine Designs**

	Using your annotated comps and the site template from our blog's Resources page, create your HTML. You can use placeholder text, but put in real text wherever possible. At this point, don't worry about layout or style. Just make sure that your HTML is well structured and will give you a good foundation to work with when we jump into CSS next week!


2. **Annotated Comps**

	You can either do these annotated comps by printing them out and marking them up with pencil/pen, or by making notes digitally within photoshop/illustrator. Either way, do it and post 'em to the blog.

3. **Start on HTML**

	Get as far as you can by next class. Even if I push back the date for Project 2 presentations, this will still be a tough project to get done in time, so work hard!
