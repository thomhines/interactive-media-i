Groups of 3
Questions to think about when discussing:

- What is consistent from one page to the next?
- What is different on each page?
- How does the style you are working with relate to the content?
- How is the composition of the page? Hierarchy?
- Is the nav clear and well-defined? Does every item on the page make sense?


### Break


### Annotated Comps
You can use **341/Resources/131031 Comps Example.psd** as an example.

Demonstrate the value of annotating comps and what to note: 

1. First: fonts, sizes, margins, padding, colors, etc.
2. Second: Pick which items are which tags
3. Last: Layout possible divs and sections with names (.sidebar, .meta-info, etc.)


### Start to Build HTML

Quick Demo on how to start converting a comp into an HTML file.


HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Finish Annotated Comps**
	
	Finish marking up your printed out comps with the 1) text styles (e.g. font size, line height, color, paddings, margins, etc.), 2) labeling which pieces of content are going to be which elements (e.g. sub-headlines = h2), and sectioning off content into various divs (e.g. .sidebar, footer, .movie_info, etc.). Then take a photo or scan of your annotated comp and post it to the blog.
	

2. **HTML & CSS**
	
	By next class, you should have the HTML done for all 5 of your pages. Again, nothing is fixed in stone, but it should be at a state where every piece of content in your comps are represented in your HTML file. Also, your CSS should be started and about the 30% mark. By this, I mean the general layout should be in place, and basic styles should be set. If you squint your eyes, your site should pretty closely resemble your design comps. After this stage, we can focus solely on refinement and making sure everything is perfect and complete.
