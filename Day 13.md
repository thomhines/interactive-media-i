### Work Session


HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Finish Web Sites**
	
	Do a great job so that I like it!

2. **Fill Out Site Launch Checklist**
	
	Make sure you've got it all checked off before you even think about turning in your site.

3. **Make a "home page" for your PSU web space**

	Create an index.html file to put in your public_html folder on the web server. It doesn't have to be styled—you can if you want—but make sure that all of the sites you've made until now are represented on this page and that each link works. Mine looks like this: [http://web.pdx.edu/~thines/](http://web.pdx.edu/~thines/). This should take no time at all for web ninjas like you guys. 

Good luck, everyone!
