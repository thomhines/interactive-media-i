### Work Session


HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Finish Web Sites** 	
	Do a great job so that I like it!

2. **Fill Out Site Launch Checklist** 	
	Make sure you've got it all checked off before you even think about turning in your site.

3. **Prepare Your Presentation**

	Like last time, we'll only have a limited amount of time for each student to present and respond, so be prepared to cover the most important aspects of your site quickly and succintly. 

Good luck, everyone!
