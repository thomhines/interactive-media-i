DANG! You guys are doing some amazing things in this project, and it seems like you're enjoying it. I'm thrilled to see how much easier and more quickly this project seems to be coming for most of you and how capable you all seem to be at solving tricky code problems. Here's your final bit of homework:


1. **Finish Project 3**

	This one's a no-brainer. Do it awesome! And if you can't do it awesome, try to at least make it not broken. Post a link and a screenshot to the blog by next Wednesday at noon. Posting late will result in a letter grade drop per day.

2. **Write About Your Design Process**

	Write 3-5 paragraphs (and I mean paragraphs, not sentences) on your design process and the decisions you made throughout the project. This will be the presentation portion of your Project 3 grade, so take it seriously. If you want an example of what I'm looking for, Serena did [a great write-up](https://art341f15blog.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/my-final-boxer-ramen/) last project in lieu of presenting. Post this along with your Project 3 link.

3. **Critique 3 Other Students' Projects**
	
	Since we aren't meeting in class to present our final projects, I want each of you to post comments on 3 other students Project 3 blog posts. Click around their site, read their write-up, and write *at least* 3 things that are working well and 3 things that they should focus on to improve. Don't repeat what other people say either. If you find that somebody already has three comments on their post, find somebody else. You won't get a grade for Project 3 if I don't see at least 3 comments from you, so DO NOT skip this. 


OK, that's enough serious stuff. I've meant it all the times I've said it this term that you guys are one of my favorite groups, and I'm really glad to have had every single one of you in my class. Good luck on finishing up your project and the rest of the term, and have a great winter break! I hope to see all of you at some point in the new year!

Happy Holidays,
Thom






2. **Site Launch Checklist**

	If you can't check off an item, please indicate why on the checklist. I'm not looking for excuses, but valid reasons. Other than a few validation errors, you should be able to check off the rest of the list without trouble.
	

3. **Self Evaluation and Design Notes**

	Before you come into the final, please write at least a few paragraphs on your design process and reasoning for the design decisions you made on your project. Consider this a script for your presentation. I'm going to be grading presentation a lot more strictly this time, so be prepared to talk intelligently about the work you did over the last few weeks.
