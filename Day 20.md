<!--1. **Evaluations**

	asdfasdf-->
	
2. **Finish Project 3**

	This one's a no-brainer. Do it awesome! And if you can't do it awesome, try to at least make it not broken.
	
3. **Site Launch Checklist**

	If you can't check off an item, please indicate why on the checklist. I'm not looking for excuses, but valid reasons. Other than a few validation errors, you should be able to check off the rest of the list without trouble.
	

4. **Self Evaluation and Design Notes**

	Before you come into the final, please write at least a few paragraphs on your design process and reasoning for the design decisions you made on your project. Consider this a script for your presentation. I'm going to be grading presentation a lot more strictly this time, so be prepared to talk intelligently about the work you did over the last few weeks.
