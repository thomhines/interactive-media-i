### Work Session




HW
---------------------------------------


1. **Research What Other Artists/Designers Are Doing**

	Find out what other creative-type people are doing in their portfolio sites. Collect as many good ideas as you can (at least three sites), and start taking notes. Post screenshots, notes, thoughts, and URLs to the blog so we can all see what you've found.


2. **Collect Content**

	Gather and prepare whatever images of your work you will need to include in your portfolio. It can be as many or as few as you want, but I would suggest getting enough so that you have a good variety to showcase. 


3. **Moodboards**

	Post at least 20 distinct pieces of inspiration (type, color, composition, etc.). This is in addition to the three examples of really good portfolio design mentioned above.


3. **3 Sets of LoFi Comps**

	I want to see at least three distinct directions of designs, with a minimum of 2 pages for each direction. These pages can be whatever you want, so long as they represent your site as a whole. They don't have to be completely polished and perfect, but they should be enough to get another designer to understand what you're thinking. And don't forget to post these to WordPress!
