1. **Finish Project 1**

	If you didn't present today, make sure you have your sites *finished* by next class!


2. **Project 1 Site Launch List**
	
	Print out and check off the [Site Launch Checklist](http://teaching.thomhines.com/resources/Site%20Launch%20Checklist.pdf). If you were unable to check off a specific item on the list, write a note next to that item indicating why. You **MUST** turn this in if you want me to grade your project 1.

	
3. **Begin Research for Project 2**
	
	By next week you should have your local company picked out, and some of the resources you might use in your designs (eg. images, logos, the company's color palette, etc.). You should also find out if your company has a website already. If you don't have a place picked out, look at [this list](http://art341s13.wordpress.com/pdx-places/) that my former TA, Barrett, compiled. Post all of your research to WordPress.
