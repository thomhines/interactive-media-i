HW
---------------------------------------

Nice work today! Tough demo, but you all made it out unscathed. Your designs are looking good, and it's great to see you guys pushing yourselves. Keep it up, y'all!


1. **Refine designs**

	Pick your favorite direction, or at least your favorite elements from the comps you brought today, and finish up your designs. You can always make small changes later, but the more you get done now, the better.

2. **Annotate your Comps**

	Just like we did with project 1, print out your comp and mark out your colors, fonts, margins, etc. It would also be a good idea to mark up which areas might belong together in divs and which elements are common between pages so you know which items to make h1, h2, h3, and so forth.

3. **Play with jQuery**

	I don't care what you do, but do something fun to the demo file we worked with in class today. Try to use at least two events (eg. hover, click), and a couple animations (eg. fadeIn, slideDown). Post a link and a very brief description of what you did to the blog! If you weren't in class, you can download the completed jQuery demo from the resources page and start from there.

4. **Start HTML/CSS**

	Next week will be mostly work sessions (with a couple small demos), so it's a very good idea to be started on your code! I would recommend having at least a couple of the pages' HTML finished and perhaps some of the CSS started. You'll want to be even further along if you want to use some jQuery in your site.

5. **ExTrA CrEdiT!!!: jQuery Codecademy**

	Just like with the HTML lessons, if you want this extra credit, you'll have to finish the first two lessons in the [jQuery](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/jquery) track. This might be especially useful for those people who weren't in class today. Post a screenshot of the congratulations/confirmation message to get credit. You have until next Tuesday to get this done.
