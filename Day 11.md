### Work session




HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Refine designs**

	Pick your favorite direction, or at least your favorite elements from the comps you brought today, and finish up your designs. You can always make small changes later, but the more you get done now, the better.

2. **Annotate your Comps**

	Just like we did with project 1, print out your comp and mark out your colors, fonts, margins, etc. It would also be a good idea to mark up which areas might belong together in divs and which elements are common between pages so you know which items to make h1, h2, h3, and so forth.

3. **Play with jQuery**

	I don't care what you do, but do something fun. Try to use at least two events (eg. hover, click), and a couple animations (eg. fadeIn, slideDown). Post a link and a very brief description of what you did to the blog!
