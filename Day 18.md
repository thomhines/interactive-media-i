HW
---------------------------------------


1. **Make Landing Page for PSU Web Space**

	If you haven't done it yet, make your PSU Home page. Mine looks like [this](http://web.pdx.edu/~thines/). 


2. **Annotated Comps**

	If you haven't done so already, make your annotated comps and post them to the blog. 
	
	
3. **HTML/CSS**

	Starting from the annotated comp, turn your design into some working code. Try your best to get your HTML finished by Thursday (you can always change it later), and get as far as you can on your CSS. We have less than two weeks before these have to be completely finished, so if you have plans to use jQuery or other tricky moves, time is very limited. Also, make sure to post a link to the blog and add Project 3 to your pdx.edu landing page!
