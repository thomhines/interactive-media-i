HW
---------------------------------------



1. **Back up your Site**

	Just in case, make sure to regularly download the files from the server onto your computer so that you don't have to start from scratch if the server goes down.

2. **Keep working!**

	We have one week to get these suckas done, so work hard! And remember, you have to complete this [checklist](http://teaching.thomhines.com/resources/Site%20Launch%20Checklist.pdf), print it out and turn it in the day of the critique!

3. Print out sites

	Use these to mark up on and make notes for which changes are the highest priority.
