HW
---------------------------------------


1. **Make HTML, Start CSS**

	Using your annotated comps and the site template from our blog's Resources page, create your HTML. You can use placeholder text, but put in real text wherever possible. At this point, don't worry about layout or style. Just make sure that your HTML is well structured and will give you a good foundation to work with when we jump into CSS next week!


2. **Make a "home page" for your PSU web space**

	Create an index.html file to put in your public_html folder on the web server. It doesn't have to be styled--you can if you want--but make sure that all of the sites you've made until now are represented on this page and that each link works. Mine looks like this: http://web.pdx.edu/~thines/ . It took me about 30 seconds to make that.
