HW
---------------------------------------

1. **3 Sets of Design Comps**

	If you didn't have three directions on Monday, get them done and post them! Don't blame me if you guys get behind on this project.


2. **Build Out One Design Direction**

	Once you have your three design directions complete, choose one and start to build it out. If you have elements or concepts from your other directions you really like, that's fine. Make the best comps you can by next week. If you aren't sure what you should focus on or want some outside opinions, post your work to the blog, and paste a URL to the blog post into an email to the whole group. Your classmates and I will give you some feedback, but only if you do it sooner rather than later.
