HW
---------------------------------------

Hey all,

I've got a good feeling about this term! Even though I'm throwing all sorts of crazy new things at you, you guys kept up like champs. Looking forward to seeing what you can do!

And speaking of which, here's the stuff I want you guys to do by next class:

1. **Install FTP and Text Editing Software**

	 If you haven't already, get [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) and [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), pronto!


2. **5-page Narrative Site**

	Create your 5-page, linear, photographic site. Sites should tell some sort of narrative (even if it's a bit abstract).Â 

	Here is the example from Miranda July:
[Noone Belongs Here More Than You](http://noonebelongsheremorethanyou.com/)

	And here are a couple nice examples that I showed in class:
	- [The Life of Ron Swanson](http://web.pdx.edu/~kpetsche/hw1/index.html)
	- [How to Make Carne Asada](http://web.pdx.edu/~ytakeda/art341_h1/index.html)


3. **Print out Web Page**

	Pick a site that has a large variety and hierarchy of content (eg. [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/), and print it out. You only need one letter-sized screenshot for our purposes, and black and white is totally fine.


4. **Post to WordPress**

	Post a screenshot of and link toyour 5-page site and 1-2 sentences describing your narrative to the class blog (Use **Add Media** to upload images). Every piece of homework is going to get posted to the blog, so this process will get to be very easy and familiar in no time. 

	If you didn't get an invitation email to join the class blog, make sure to let me know so that I can try to add you again. NOTE: After you sign up for a WordPress account, you DO NOT need to create your own blog! WordPress make it seem like that's the next natural step after you've set your username and password. Instead, after you've put in your account info, go back to the invitation email and click the button again to join the class blog. This time it will work.
