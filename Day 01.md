HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Install FTP and Sditing Software**

	Mac Folks: If you weren't able to get it done in class, download and install [Coda](http://panic.com/coda/). I will be teaching off of this app for the rest of the term, and it will make much more sense if we are all on the same page. Trust me, it's worth it.
	
	To get the discount mentioned in class, fill out this [form](http://art341w14.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/panic-psu-discount-cc-form.pdf) and send it to June <june@panic.com> at Panic. She'll get you squared away. You'll need to use your @pdx.edu email address for this to work. (And make *sure* to give a big 'thank you!')

	Windows People: Get brackets and FireFTP, pronto! Sorry, no special deals for you.


2. **5-page Narrative Site**

	Create your 5-page, linear, photographic site. Sites should tell some sort of narrative (even if it's a bit abstract).Â 

	Here is the example from Miranda July:
[Noone Belongs Here More Than You](http://noonebelongsheremorethanyou.com/)

	And here are a couple nice examples that I showed in class:
	- [The Life of Ron Swanson](http://web.pdx.edu/~kpetsche/hw1/index.html)
	- [How to Make Carne Asada](http://web.pdx.edu/~ytakeda/art341_h1/index.html)


3. **Post to WordPress**

	Post a screenshot of one page of your 5-page site and 1-2 sentences describing your site to WordPress. Every piece of homework is going to get posted to the blog, so this process will get to be very easy and familiar in no time.
