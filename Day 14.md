### Work Session




HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Finish Web Sites** 	
	Even those of you who presented on Thursday should do everything you can to make your site as polished and functional as possible. I've extended the deadline and given you very little homework over the weekend, so I'm expecting excellence. I will hold off on grading all sites until Tuesday night.

2. **Fill Out Site Launch Checklist** 	
	If you didn't already have it all checked off, make sure you have it done by Tuesday. And if you make changes to your code, be sure to check to see if it still validates!

3. **Prepare Your Presentation**

	I know this is a long, tough term, but you need to sell me and your classmates on your sites. You shouldn't have to wait for us to ask why you made certain decisions, but rather, should convince us that you put thought into every aspect of your site and prove it by describing what you've done and why you did it. Remember, presentations are a big part of your grade!
