HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Refine Designs (All 5 Pages)**
	
	Take what we talked about in class today and keep pushing your work. Pick one direction and start to nail down your design decisions. Feel free to experiment a little, but start to hone in on the final form. You can always change your mind later if you aren't happy with something, but the better it looks now, the less of a headache it will be to make your web files. PUSH IT. If you haven't already, expand your designs so that you have a design for each of your five pages.

2. **Print Your Site**â€¨	
	Come to class with your designs printed, one sheet per web page. You'll want plenty of room to mark it up and take notes on these print-outs.
