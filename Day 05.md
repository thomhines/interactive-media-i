### Crit 3 design directions

Split groups up into groups of 4-5 (probably 5). I'll speak one-on-one with students as I see that they need it, and meet with the rest on Thursday.

Questions to think about when discussing:

- What is consistent from one page to the next?
- What is different on each page?
- How does the style you are working with relate to the content?
- How is the composition of the page? Hierarchy?
- Is the nav clear and well-defined? Does every item on the page make sense?






HW
---------------------------------------

Hey all,

We pretty much only have this week and next week to do ALL of the code for Project 1, so your goal for next class is to be done with design and ready to move to development (programming). We'll be doing annotated comps next class, so make sure you don't forget to print your designs!


1. **Refine Designs (All 5 Pages)**
	
	Take what we talked about in class today and keep pushing your work. Pick one direction and start to nail down your design decisions. Feel free to experiment a little, but start to hone in on the final form. You can always tweak things later if you aren't happy with something, but the better it looks now, the less of a headache it will be to make your web files. Project 1 is due in two weeks, so PUSH IT.

	If you haven't already, expand your designs so that you have a design for each of your five pages. 


2. **Print Your Site**â€¨	
	
	Come to class with your designs printed, one sheet per web page. Black and white is fine, and they don't have to be huge, but you'll want plenty of room to mark it up and take notes on these print-outs.
