CLASS
---------------------------------------


### Quiz
[codepen](http://codepen.io/thomhines/pen/eratJ) - [completed](http://codepen.io/thomhines/pen/zfcyl)
- How do we add a 20px margin to the divs? What happens when a margin is set with 2 values? 3 values? 4 values?
- How do we get the divs to sit next to each other in a grid? (float)
	- How do we get the border to sit around the divs? (clearfix)
- What does absolute positioning do?
	- How do we set the position of an absolutely positioned element? (top, left, bottom, right)
	- Do we use margins? NO!
	- Do we use top, left, bottom, right on relatively positioned elements? NO!
- What's the difference between absolute and fixed positioning?
- As a group, fix problems in some example code (HTML/CSS split screen)




### Housekeeping

- Discuss HW: Two-Column Design Duplication
	- Who did it well? 
	- Who ran into problems? 
	- Recreate assignment #3 in front of class
		- **Use Firebug**
		- **Show Validation services**


### Good Website Design Research

As a group, go over sites that students found and talk about what made some designs good and what appeals to them.



### Webfonts
- [Google Web Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)

Maybe demo on [assignment 1](http://web.pdx.edu/~thines/341/assignment1/)


### Crit 3 design directions

Split groups up into groups of 4-5 (probably 5). I'll speak one-on-one with students as I see that they need it, and meet with the rest on Thursday.

Questions to think about when discussing:

- Does it feel like a cohesive system? What is consistent from one page to the next?
- What is different on each page?
- How does the style of the design with relate to the content?
- How is the composition of the page? Does it use white space effectively? Is there good hierarchy?
- Does every item on the page make sense?






HW
---------------------------------------

Hey all,

We pretty much only have this week and next week to do ALL of the code for Project 1, so your goal for next class is to be done with design and ready to move to development (programming). We'll be doing annotated comps next class, so make sure you don't forget to print your designs!


1. Another Set of Wireframes

	Before refining your final comps, Expand and build wireframes for all 5 pages using the best Information Architecture and compositions from your initial design directions. Think about ways you can make each page unique, but still using the same overarching patterns.

1. **Refine Designs (At Least 3 Pages)**
	
	Take what we talked about in class today and keep pushing your work. Pick one direction and start to nail down your design decisions. Feel free to experiment a little, but start to hone in on the final form. The reason you're making three pages is so you can show how pages are similar, and yet different, from one or your Project 1 items to another. You can always tweak things later if you aren't happy with something, but the better it looks now, the less of a headache it will be to make your web files. Project 1 is due in two weeks, so PUSH IT.


2. **Print Your Site**â€¨	
	
	Come to class with your designs printed, one sheet per web page. Black and white is fine, and they don't have to be huge, but you'll want plenty of room to mark it up and take notes on these print-outs. 


And as promised here are some Project 1 Student Examples:

- [Pokemon](http://web.pdx.edu/~alan4/HRNZ341PRJ1/bulbasaur.html)
- [Josh Doll's Shoes](http://web.pdx.edu/~joshdoll/shoes/)
- [The Website About Nothing](http://web.pdx.edu/~phillip2/websiteaboutnothing/index.html)
