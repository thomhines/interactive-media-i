CLASS
---------------------------------------

### Housekeeping
Explain that all testing should be done in browsers, not in Preview mode of Coda or Live View in Brackets


### Finish Project 1 Presentations


### Discuss Web Site Usability
- What were the elements that made sites more usable? Less?
- In what ways did the 'pretty sites' get in their own way?
- Are there times when a site's aesthetics can make a *positive* impact on usability?



### Brackets Plugins
- [Emmet](http://emmet.io/)
- [SFTP Upload](https://github.com/bigeyex/brackets-sftp-upload)



### Photoshop

[Setting up Photoshop for the web](http://davidmckinney.com/blog/2013/12/31/designing-iphone-apps-how-to-setup-photoshop)

Particularly the part about [color settings](http://davidmckinney.com/blog/2013/12/31/designing-iphone-apps-how-to-setup-photoshop#block-dcb0243066f19c3bd06b).
- Edit > Color Settings: Set RGB to **Monitor RGB**
- View > Proof Colors: Uncheck this


#### Proper Etiquette
[PS Etiquette](http://photoshopetiquette.com/)

Items to point out:

- Name files appropriately (with timestamp is a good idea)
- Keep all of your external assets in a folder relative to your PSD file
- Name layers and user folders
- Snap to Grid (View > Snap to…)
- Use whole number pixel sizes for fonts and shapes

- Save for Web… (Show on image with partial transparency)
	- 4-up view
	- Checking file sizes
	- 24-bit PNG for transparency
	- Make sure sRGB option is TURNED OFF.
	
- Comps (Using Comps Example.psd)
	- Create New Comps for Contact Page (turn on Contact page elements and nav highlight)
	- Update all comps to use underline for nav instead of highlight (use update Comp button in Comps palette)
	- Show how you can adjust position as well as visibility when creating a new Comp (Move an item, then create new Comp layer, and select the Position checkbox)




### Designing for the web in Illustrator
[Speed Design w/ Illustrator](http://www.designsprint.net/)

- Creating and resizing shapes quickly
- [1200px grid system](http://1200px.com/) - Also has template for Photoshop!
- Select by Style
- Edit > Edit Colors
- Applying rounded corners, drop shadows, gradients, etc.
- Moving values from AI -> CSS
- Character/Paragraph Styles





### Discuss clients for Project 2
- What place are you going to design a site for?
- Do they have a site already?
- How would you describe the character of this place?
- Who is their primary audience/clientele?
- What is the most useful info that their clients would need access to?




HW
---------------------------------------


1. **Moodboards**

	No minimum or maximum number of elements, but this time when you're making a mood board, write notes for how each element in your mood board could contribute to your Project 2 designs. This could involve things like how another site uses texture, or how they crop their images, or how they set up their navigation, or the tone and character of the site. These might be less specific than fonts and color palettes, but make an effort to register *why* you think a particular design is inspirational.


2. **3 Sets of Wireframes**

	Make three distinct directions in how you might want to lay out your pages. For now, you can do just two pages per wireframe set (6 wireframes total), but make sure that your ideas come through. If two frames isn't enough, write about your thoughts or do an extra frame or two until you've clearly communicated what you're thinking. Remember, these are for you, not me. Get as many ideas down as quickly as you can.


3. **3 Sets of Design Comps**

	Turn one or more of your wireframe directions into three different design directions. Again, at least two comps per direction. We are going to discuss this in groups next class, so be prepared to show and explain your concepts to your classmates and to me.
