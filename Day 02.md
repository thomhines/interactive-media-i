ART 341 - Day 2
=======================================

1. Diving deeper into servers and HTML
2. Introduce Project 1
3. Have a great time



PREP
---------------------------------------
- Post Project 1 Brief to blog
- Post this to resources page: [HTML Cheat Sheet](http://www.addedbytes.com/download/html-cheat-sheet-v1/png/)
- Load up examples for Project 1 [The Many Faces of Alan Rickman](http://themanyfacesof.com/alan-rickman/), past student work
- Have a working version of HW 1 in order to update it to proper HTML along with the class






Class
---------------------------------------

### Quiz 
- What is the tag name for adding a link to a web page?
	- What does that look like?
- What about adding an image? 
- [Go over several people's sites]


### Housekeeping
- Have all students log into WP and update their user names
- Install Chrome, because it's the best
- Create .htaccess file and add this line to prevent Google from indexing sites:

		Header set X-Robots-Tag "noindex, nofollow"


- Questions?



### More HTML

Use keynote presentation for Day 2


- Extra time?
	- embed from youtube/vimeo
	- header/footer/nav
	- ul/ol
	- tables

Also worth mentioning:
- [HTML Validator](http://validator.w3.org/)
- Coda built-in validator!



### Break


### Making HTML from a Comp

Students: Using the sites that people brought to class, have them annotate them.

Me: Load non-annotated version of image to create some HTML



### Discuss Project 1




#### Examples
- [Many Faces of Alan Rickman](http://themanyfacesof.com/alan-rickman/)
- [Kirby of the Stars](http://web.pdx.edu/~chereea/kirby/index.html)
- [Batman: Ally or Foe?](http://web.pdx.edu/~mml2/batman_web/)
- [Pokemon](http://web.pdx.edu/~alan4/HRNZ341PRJ1/bulbasaur.html)
- [Josh Doll's Shoes](http://web.pdx.edu/~joshdoll/shoes/)
- [The Website About Nothing](http://web.pdx.edu/~phillip2/websiteaboutnothing/index.html)


#### Initial Research

Let students start researching Project 1 (getting text content, images, etc.) while I debug problems with other students














HW
---------------------------------------

1. Create .htaccess file and add this line to prevent Google from indexing sites:
	
		Header set X-Robots-Tag "noindex, nofollow"


1. **Update Your 5-Page Narrative**

	Update your 5-page linear narrative site to be valid HTML *(make sure it [validates](http://validator.w3.org/)!)*. This means you will need to add the proper tags in the <head> section, the <doctype> tag, and ensure that all of your tags are used correctly (including closing tags!). And don't forget to add the `alt` attribute to all of your images (eg. `<img src="funnypic.jpg" alt="a brief description of image">`). 

	Also, make sure to add a few of the tags we learned in class to the site, as well. At a minimum, your site should have at least one of each of these tags: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`.


3. **Post It**

	Post the URL of your 5-page site to the blog as a clickable link, and with a screenshot. I know you already posted screenshots of the same site a couple days ago, but I want you to post at least one screenshot in *EVERY* blog post you make for this class. Users need a visual clue as to what they are looking at.


4. **Start Project 1**

	Begin research on the subject for our first project. Again, the site you make should be about a "set" of four things. This could be anything from the four members of Led Zeppelin, to four contemporary painters, to your four favorite types of Japanese candies. They should all have something in common, but easy enough to tell apart. Like "[The Many Faces of Alan Rickman](http://themanyfacesof.com/alan-rickman/)", you want people to see a pattern, but still have a sense that there are important differences in style and content.

	After you've picked a topic, start collecting images, text, and consider what you want to include as meta data about your subjects. **Post your content and images to the blog. *AND* send an email to art341w15-group@pdx.edu and let the rest of the class know what you plan to make your site about.**
