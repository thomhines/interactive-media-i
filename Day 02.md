Class
---------------------------------------

### Housekeeping
- Have all students log into WP and update their user names
- Questions?


### Quiz 
- What is the tag name for adding a link to a web page?
	- What does that look like?
- What about adding an image? 
- [Go over several people's sites]

### Validators
- [HTML Validator](http://validator.w3.org/)
- Coda built-in validator!

### Web Server

- Set up personal servers
	- post personal sites to server

- odin.pdx.edu
- odin login info
- http://web.pdx.edu/~thines



- public_html

- ***Server files are case sensitive!***



- tags
	- structure
	- attributes (why href, src?)
	- self-closing

- white space
	- collapses
	- <br> tag

- head and body

- relative links and absolute links

- HTML5

Example:

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en-us">
	<head>
		<title>TMNT</title>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<meta name="description" content="A depressing tale of the Ninja Turtles." />
	</head>
	
	<body>
	
	…
	
	</body>



- More tags:
	- h1-h6
	- p 
	- b, i, strong, em
	- div
	- section
	- article
	- alt tags

- Extra time?
	- embed from youtube/vimeo
	- ul/ol
	- header/footer/nav
	- tables


**But it still looks ugly… wait til next week**

HW
---------------------------------------
1. **UPDATE YOUR HTML**

	Update your 5-page linear narrative site to be valid HTML *(make sure it [validates](http://validator.w3.org/)!)*. This means you will need to add the proper tags in the <head> section, the <doctype> tag, and ensure that all of your tags are used correctly (including closing tags!). And don't forget to add the **alt** attribute to all of your images (eg. `<img src="funnypic.jpg" alt="a brief description of image">`). 


2. **ADD NEW TAGS**

	Add a few of the tags we learned in class to the site, as well. At a minimum, your site should include these tags: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`.


3. **POST IT**

	Post the URL of your 5-page site to the blog as a clickable link, and with a screenshot. I know you already posted screenshots of the same site a couple days ago, but I want you to post at least one screenshot in *EVERY* blog post you make for this class. Users need a visual clue as to what they are looking at.


4. **START PROJECT 1**

	Begin research on the subject for our first project. Again, the site you make should be about a "set" of four things. This could be anything from the four members of Led Zeppelin, to four contemporary painters, to your four favorite types of Japanese candies. They should all have something in common, but easy enough to tell apart. Like "[The Many Faces of Alan Rickman](http://themanyfacesof.com/alan-rickman/)", you want people to see a pattern, but still have a sense that there are important differences in style and content.

	After you've picked a topic, start collecting images, text, and consider what you want to include as meta data about your subjects. **Post your content and images to the blog.**
