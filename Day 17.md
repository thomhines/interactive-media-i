HW
---------------------------------------


1. **Research Good Looking Bad Websites**

	Find a website that you think has good aesthetics but poor usability. This is somewhat subjective, so use your best judgment. Then post a screenshot (or several) and a link of your site, along with 5 *specific* aspects of the ways in which the designer was able to create a good looking site, as well as 5 reasons why the site's usability is not so good. 


2. **Refine Designs**

	Based on the feedback you got in class today, clean up your designs, fill in details, and get as close to being finished as you can. Then post your designs to the blog, and print out your designs to bring to next class.
