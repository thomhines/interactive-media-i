HW
---------------------------------------


1. **Research Good Looking Bad Websites**

	Find a website that you think has good aesthetics but poor usability. This is somewhat subjective, so use your best judgment. Then post a screenshot (or several) and a link of your site, along with 5 *specific* aspects of the ways in which the designer was able to create a good looking site, as well as 5 reasons why the site's usability is not so good. 


2. **Refine Designs**

	Based on the feedback you got in class today, clean up your designs, fill in details, and get as close to being finished as you can. Then post your designs to the blog, and print out your designs to bring to next class.

Fall 2015
------

Good job with Project 2, everyone! Fantastic work! You guys should be really proud of the sites you made. And now on to Project 3...


1. **Project 2 Self-Evaluation**

	Please write 1-2 paragraphs on what you thought of the project, how you feel you did, what you learned, what you wish you did differently, etc. I'd like to know how this process was for you. And as always, post it to the blog.


2. **Print out your Poster for Project 3**

	We haven't talked about these digital posters all that much, but the main objective is to break your poster down into pieces that you can make with HTML/CSS. Here are some suggestions for a good poster: vector or text shapes that you can recreate in HTML, big hierarchy, enough complexity to make it interesting, texture, color, elements that bleed off the page or imply depth. I'm linking to a number of posters at the bottom of this email that I think might be good examples of some of these attributes.


3. **Come up with 5 Interactions/Animations**

	Think about how you can make your poster more engaging and active to your users. You aren't obligated to do any of the things you list, but at least come up with 5 ideas you could work with.
