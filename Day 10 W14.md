1. **Project 1 Site Launch List**
	
	If you didn't give it to me before you left class, please email me your checklist before this weekend. As I mentioned before, I'm not going to grade your site until I have that.


2. **Write a Self-Evaluation**
	
	I'd like you to make a brief post in WordPress that goes over your thoughts on Project 1, how you feel you did, what you like about your project, what you would have done differently, the aspect of your site you're most proud of, and whatever else you would like to write. A couple paragraphs should be enough.


3. **Begin Research for Project 2**
	
	By next class you should have your local company picked out, and some of the resources you might use in your designs (eg. images, logos, the company's color palette, etc.). You should also find out if your company has a website already. If you don't have a place picked out, look at [this list](http://art341s13.wordpress.com/pdx-places/) that my former TA, Barrett, compiled. Post all of your research to WordPress.
	
4. **Wireframes**

	Once you have at least a really solid idea of your Project 2 content, start to organize it into pages and compositions. I'd like to see at least 2 directions of wireframes that you can start designing toward next week. Remember, we have less than three weeks to get these sites done, so don't slack now!

	
5. **Website Review**

	Find one site that is good looking but has poor usability, and one site that has great usability but maybe doesn't look all that good. Then write five reasons why the usability of each site is good/bad, along with screen shots, and post them to the blog. We'll go over these in class next week.
