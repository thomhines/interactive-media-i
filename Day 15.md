### Project 2 Final Crits



HW
---------------------------------------

Great presentations today, guys! I'm really happy with how your sites turned out and how you talked about them. Wonderful. Can't wait to see the rest on Thursday!

Also, I just wanted to draw your attention to class attendance for a minute. Several people's grades have been adversely affected by missing class, and several more are on the cusp. Remember, 3 absences drops your grade by 5%, 3 absences drop it by 10%, and you get an automatic fail at 5 absences. This includes coming to class late, as well. Two times coming late or leaving early count as an absence. And coming to class more than 15 minutes late is a full absence, so make sure to be here and on time! We only have a couple weeks left of class, so let's keep it together, folks!


1. **Project 2 Self-Evaluation**

	Please write 1-2 paragraphs on what you thought of the project, how you feel you did, what you learned, what you wish you did differently, etc. I'd like to know how this process was for you. 


2. **Site Launch Checklist**

	If you didn't give it to me in class, please bring it with you on Thursday. I'm not going to grade your Project 2 if I don't have it! For any elements that you weren't able to check off, please write a small note as to why.


3. **Landing Page**

	Like I mentioned in class, be sure to create a landing page for your public_html folder (it should be called index.html) that includes links to all of your assignments and projects. Here's [mine](http://web.pdx.edu/~thines/) as an example. It doesn't have to look good, but it couldn't hurt. After you've uploaded that to the server, make sure to post a link to your landing page on the blog!


4. **Portfolio Site Moodboard/Research**

	In order to hit the ground running on Project 3, I want you to come prepared to start working on your portfolio on Tuesday (Project 3, fyi, is a portfolio site). You should have your images picked out and preliminary descriptions written about each piece you want to present. Look at other designers and see what they do. Look for inspiration in other sites. If you want to include a resume, bio, or contact page, start writing the copy for those pages now. 

	If you are doing something other than a portfolio site (and have discussed this with me), you still need to have the majority of your content and web pages picked out and brought to class, too.

	Post your research (including a screenshot and link to at least one portfolio that has elements you want to incorporate into your design) and bring your content to class on Thursday.
