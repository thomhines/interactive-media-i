---------------------------------------


1. **Project 3 Content Inventory**

	In order to hit the ground running on Project 3, I want you to come prepared to start working on your portfolio on Tuesday (Project 3, fyi, is a portfolio site). You should have your images picked out and preliminary descriptions written about each piece you want to present. Look at other designers and see what they do. Look for inspiration in other sites. If you want to include a resume, bio, or contact page, start writing the copy for those pages now. 
If you are doing something other than a portfolio site (and have discussed this with me), you still need to have the majority of your content and web pages picked out and brought to class, too. Let's not waste any time, folks!

2. **Project 2 Self-Evaluation**

	Please write 1-2 paragraphs on what you thought of the project, how you feel you did, what you learned, what you wish you did differently, etc. I'd like to know how this process was for you. 

3. **Site Launch Checklist**

	If you didn't give it to me in class, please bring it with you on Thursday. I'm not going to grade your assignment if I don't have it! For any elements that you weren't able to check off, please write a small note as to why.

4. **Codecademy jQuery Extra Credit**

	There's an entire track of jQuery lessons on Codecademy for anybody who's interested in learning more and getting better at it. If you are interested in improving your jQuery skills and/or want a boost to your grade, finish the first two lessons (Introducing jQuery and jQuery functions), and post a screen shot of your completed lessons list (http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery) to the blog. You guys have one week to get EC for this!
